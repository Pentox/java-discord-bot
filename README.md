# Discord bot with Java

This simple repository gives you what you need in order to start out your Discord development journey with Java and Discord4J.

In order to use this, you will first have to get the shaded jar or the Maven dependency to use the API, available [here](https://github.com/austinv11/Discord4J).
After you've downloaded the shaded jar, attach it to your project. If you're using Maven, add the dependency as described in the article and it will download them when you build the project.
